This is my notes about **Java Spring MVC**. 
Content is about 30 minutes read, its purpose is:
- To refresh your memory if you already worked on it. 
- Or if you are totally new, it will give you an overview, so you can kick start your first Java Spring MVC application.

## Installation
Windows:
 - [ ] JDK
 - [ ] Download Spring libraries (then add to build path)


## ClassPathXmlApplicationContext

In Java Spring Core, there is a module named BeanFactory. You can imagine the Bean is like Object in OOP. BeanFactory allows you to access objects defined in Xml bean configuration file. 

> So why using object (Bean) defined in xml file but not instantiate the objects in source code directly?
